# Fastify API 

## Purpose & Description

This project was created to try and test out the concepts I learned regarding Fastify, MongoDB, Node.JS and Swagger. I had no prior experience working with Fastify or Swagger. I am working towards implementing Swagger into a professional project and wanted to test it out on a personal project. Fastify was another API builder that was very helpful tool to understand.
